# Gang of Four Design Patterns

## Creational Design Patterns   

* [Abstract Factory](https://github.com/tvttavares/gof/tree/master/abstract-factory). Allows the creation of objects without specifying their concrete type. 

* [Builder](https://github.com/tvttavares/gof/tree/master/buider). Uses to create complex objects.

* [Factory Method](https://github.com/tvttavares/gof/tree/master/factory-method). Create objects without specifying the exact class to create.

* [Prototype](https://github.com/tvttavares/gof/tree/master/prototype). Creates a new object from an existing object.

* [Singleton](https://github.com/tvttavares/gof/tree/master/singleton). Ensures only one instance of an object is created.

## Structural Design Patterns

* [Adapter](https://github.com/tvttavares/gof/tree/master/adapter). Allows for two incompatible classes to work together by wrapping an interface around one of the existing classes.

* [Bridge](https://github.com/tvttavares/gof/tree/master/bridge). Decouples an abstraction so two classes can vary independently.

* [Composite](https://github.com/tvttavares/gof/tree/master/composite). Takes a group of objects into a single object.

* [Decorator](https://github.com/tvttavares/gof/tree/master/decorator). Allows for an object’s behavior to be extended dynamically at run time.

* [Facade](https://github.com/tvttavares/gof/tree/master/facade). Provides a simple interface to a more complex underlying object.

* [Flyweight](https://github.com/tvttavares/gof/tree/master/flyweight). Reduces the cost of complex object models.

## Structural Design Patterns

* [Chain of Responsibility](https://github.com/tvttavares/gof/tree/master/chain-of-responsibility). Delegate commands to a chain of processing objects.
