# Gang of Four Design Patterns

## Creational Design Patterns   

* [Abstract Factory](https://github.com/tvttavares/gof/tree/master/abstract-factory). Allows the creation of objects without specifying their concrete type. 

* [Builder](https://github.com/tvttavares/gof/tree/master/buider). Uses to create complex objects.

* [Factory Method](https://github.com/tvttavares/gof/tree/master/factory-method). Create objects without specifying the exact class to create.

* [Singleton](https://github.com/tvttavares/gof/tree/master/singleton). Ensures only one instance of an object is created.
